- some asset types should be non-transferable
- add some way to "control" a site once there is a way to contest such control
- add interaction between players and sites, exploring and competing for the sites
- right now unlimited recipes can use a single site, sites should be limited resources in some fashion
- currently if I want both the account and a factory to be able to build converters, I have to duplicate the recipe. I need either an a array of facility type IDs, or I need capability flags and tie the recipes to those.
